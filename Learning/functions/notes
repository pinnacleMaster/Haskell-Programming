Notes:

Function syntax : func_name :: (type var) => _variable (-> otherVariables) -> return type

- Note that the braces were only used to that you can add other variables by adding ->variable->variable and so on.
- Note that the variables can be simpletons, tuples, arrays, lists etc.
- the variables in the lists or simpletons, must be of the same type.
